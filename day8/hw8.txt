[ x] I completed this assignment without assistance or external resources.
[ ] I completed this assignment with assistance from ___
   and/or using these external resources: ___

   1)
    a) Assume that language L is regular. String w such that w >= c and w is split up as xyz.
    For the string aaaa, where w is "aa", repeating w gives us a string whose length is no 
    longer a power of 2. Therefore, we don't have a regular language.

    b) Regular. the expression would be /(1^+0*1^+)^N(0^+1*0^+)^N/

    c) Assuming that language L is regular, we choose and string where String w >= c annd
    w is split up as xyzb where b is the reverse of xyzb. If y loops a number of times, b is no
    longer the reverse of xy^az. Therefore, we don't have a regular language.

    2)
    a)  L={𝚊n𝚋n∣n∈ℕ} 
        My word = a9b9
        My choice = a9b3 from that word
        computer chose = the first 2 b's
        I repeated twice and won with a9b11
    b) L={𝚊n∣n is prime}
        My word = a19
        My choice = a19
        Computer chose = a7 
        My winning string = a33
