I. Math

In the following problems, we will look at how rapidly different functions grow.  We are interested in figuring out when two functions grow at the same rate.  Our definition of “the same” is:  f(n) grows no faster than g(n) if there is some minimum value for the argument (we’ll call it n0) after which f(n) is no larger than a constant multiple of g(n) -- call it k*g(n).  For example, if f(n) is 367n+1098 and g(n) is 2n, n0 could be 40 and k could be 200:  367n+1098 <= 200*2n for n>40.

For each of the following pairs of functions, identify a multiplier and a minimum value of n for which the first is no larger than the specified multiple of the second.  If you cannot -- if there are no such values -- explain why not.


  A. 367n+1098     and     2n                  [n0 = 40; k=200]
  B. n^2 + 2n + 6    and     6n^2 - 25    [n0 = 5; k= 69]
  C. n^3 + n^2 - 2n     and     6n^2 - 25   [No solution, a cube will always grow faster than a square]
  D. 869,438    and    923    [I'm not sure what the comma operator means here]
  E. 2^n    and    3^n     [n0 = 2; k = 69]
  F. 3^n    and    2^n    [No solution, 3^n will grow much faster than 2^n]
  G. log_2 n     and    log_10 n    [No solution, althrough log functions grow slowly logbase2 can always be increased enough to overcome any constant multiplier. It will just take a realllllllly big number to do it]
  H. log_10 n^2    and     log_2 n    [n0 = 5; k = 69]


II. Linear data structures

For the following problem, assume that it costs 1 unit to access a structure -- an item in an array, a field in a record you are holding, the first element in a linked list -- whether reading or writing that element.  [Accessing the second element in a linked list costs 2 units if you have a pointer to the list:  1 unit to access the first element/read its “next” pointer, and another unit to access the second element.]

Assume that you have n elements stored in an array and the same n elements stored in a linked list; you have no other references to these data structures.  You may assume that n > 10.  How much does it cost to perform each of the following actions?

  A. Read the value of the first element in the array?  In the list?
      1 and 1
  B. Read the value of the seventh element in the array?  In the list?
      1 and 7
  C. Add an element to the array?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]  To the list?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]
      n in worst case, cheapest is the end. n in worst case, cheapest is beginning
  D. Delete the fifth element from the array?  From the list?
      n and 5
  E. Confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?
      n and n in worst case
  F. Confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is NOT present in the array?  In the list?
      n and n in worst case

Now assume that you can maintain one extra piece of storage for the data structure.  In the case of the array, you may want to maintain a length reference.
In the case of the linked list, what would be similarly helpful?
    maintain a reference to the last element
G. How much would it cost now to add an element to the end of the array?  To add an element to the end of the list?
    1 and 1
H. How much would it cost now to delete an element from the array?  From the list?  What if it were the final element?  The penultimate element?
    (n,n); (1,1); (n, 2)

Finally, assume that both the array and the linked list are sorted, i.e., that their elements are in some predictable order (say, comparable by < or <=).
  J. How much would it cost to confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?  To confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is not present in the array?  In the list?
  worst case for array is log(n) for both. Worst case for list is n, being sorted doesn't necesarily help
