## 0. [Not a question] Terminology

In class on Monday, we drew [**call graphs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) of the `fib` function, with and without memoization.

This particular kind of call graph is a **dynamic call graph**, whose nodes are function *invocations* during the execution of a program. The nodes of a **static call graph** are function *names*; arrows indicate appearances of a call in the program source text.

A dynamic call graph of a *recursive* function is also called a **recursion graph**.

## 1. Predicate Calculus – Models

Consider Table 1:

| x    | y    |
| ---- | ---- |
| a    | b    |
| b    | c    |
| a    | c    |
| c    | d    |
| d    | c    |
| c    | c    |
| b    | a    |

*Table 1*: A model for `loves(x, y)`

a. For each of the following, is Table 1 a model?  Explain briefly why or why not.

1. ∃x. ∀y. loves(x, y)
no, there is no x that loves all y
2. ∃y. ∀x. loves(x, y)
yes, c is loved by all possible x
3. ∀x. ∃y. loves(x, y)
yes, all x love at least one y
4. ∀y. ∃x. loves(x, y)
yes, all y is loved by someone
5. ∃x. ∃y. loves(x, y)
yes, there is at least one x that loves one y
6. ∃x. ∀y. ¬loves(x, y)
no, all x love at least one y
7. ∃x. ¬∀y. loves(x, y)
no, all x love at least one y

b. Consider three models: (i) objects are a, b, c, d; `loves` is Table 1; (ii) objects are integers; `loves(x, y) ` ≝ x ≧ y; (iii) `loves(x, y)` ≝ x = y. In which of these models are these statements true:

| Statement                                | Table 1 | x ≧ y | x = y |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| ∀x, x. loves(x, x)                       |    true     |    false   |    true   |
| ∀x, y. loves(x, y) → loves(y, x)         |     true    |    false   |    true   |
| ∀x, y, z. loves(x, y) ∧ loves(y, z) → loves(x, z) |     true    |   true    |    true   |

c. (Optional) (Because we love graphs) Draw Table 1 as a digraph. What claims do each of the following make about a node x or y, in terms of its indegree and outdegree?

1. ∀x. loves(x, y)
2. ∀y. loves(x, y)
3. ∃x. loves(x, y)
4. ∃y. loves(x, y)

## 2. Predicate Calculus – Proofs

Given axioms:

1. ∀x. sum( x, 0, x )
2. ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( x, s(y), s(z) )
3. ∀x . product( x, 0, 0 )
4. ∀x, y, z, k. product( x, y, z ) ∧  sum( x, z, k ) → product( x, s(y), k )

Prove:

1.  ∃x. sum( x, x, s(s(0)) )
y = s(0), then sum(y,0,0) = sum(s(0), 0, s(0)) then for sum(y,s(0),s(y)) = sum(s(0), s(0), s(s(0))) for y by axiom 2
2.  ∀x. sum( 0, x, x ) [hint:  induction]
hypothesis: there is a j, such that sum(0,j,j) exists
each inductive step is: sum(0,j,j) to sum(0,s(j),s(j)) by axiom 2
3.  [optional super-challenge] ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( y, x, z )

## 3. Maximum Subarray

The [maximum subarray problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) (*aka* maximum contiguous subsequence, *aka* maximum value contiguous subsequence) is “the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)).

```python
# Source: wikipedia 
def max_subarray(xs):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in xs:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
```

a. Draw a recursion graph of `max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.
i don't see a recursive call, appears to be more iterative. 
b. Is `max_subarray` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not?
divide and conquer is a recursive concept, this isn't recursive. however, it doesn't look like it's divide and conquer
c. Is `max_subarray` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not?
doesn't look like it, we're not really doing anything recursively
d. Consider a *memoized* version of `max_subarray`. (You don't need to produce code for this. You do need to understand what memoization does to a call graph.) Draw the recursion graph for `memoized_max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.
not sure if it would be faster. The current solution is O(N) already, I don't know if any recursive solution would be faster
e. [Optional challenge] Produce working code for memoized `max_subarray`.

## 4. Binary Search

```python
def binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, right):
    if left == right: return None
    middle = int((left + right) / 2)
    if x < xs[middle]:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, middle)
    elif xs[middle] < x:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, middle, right)
    else:
        return middle

def binary_search_array(x, xs):
    return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, 0, len(xs))
```

a. Above is an implementation of the [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). Draw the recursion graph for `binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))`.
binary_search_array(3, arr) -> binary_helper(3, arr, 0, 9) -> binary_helper(3, arr, 1, 7) -> binary_helper(3, arr, 1, 4) ->returns 3
b. Is `binary_search_array` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not?
yep, we divide the array until we have our result
c. Is `binary_search_array` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not?
I don't think so, because we're not storing any results to use later on
d. Consider a memoized version of `binary_binary_search_array_helper`. Draw the recursion graph for a function memoized `memoized_binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))` that calls `memoized_binary_search_array_helper`.
I'm really not sure how this would work. What subresults would it be caching for later?
e. Under what circumstances does the `memoized_binary_search_array` present any benefits over the unmemoized original? How does this relate to (i) its recursion graph; (ii) the key attributes of a dynamic program?
Again, I'm not sure how it would be faster. Would we be saving results for some common things to find? Or looking through the list if it's a short array.
f. [Optional challenge] Find the bug in `binary_search_array`. What input will cause it to fail? How can this be fixed? (Hint: it is a bug that appears for small arrays. Python is not susceptible to [this bug](https://research.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).)
